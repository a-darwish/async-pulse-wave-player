## Introduction

This is a minimal WAV file audio player created for the purpose of
prototyping PulseAudio asynchronous APIs.

Run the attached `test_wave_player.sh` script to play a number of
sample WAV files, already uploaed to the repo, in a quick loop.

Please open an issue if any unexpected behavior, or any audible
cracks, are heard.
