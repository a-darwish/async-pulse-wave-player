===========

* WavSource.com Usage Policy:

Access to WavSource is free. There are only a few rules that visitors
are asked to observe.

1. If you like certain sounds or pictures at WavSource and wish to use
them on your own web site or post them to a blog site (such as MySpace,
Facebook, or Twitter), you must first copy them to your own server or
the blog server and link to them from there.  DO NOT link directly to
sounds or pictures residing on my server. That steals my bandwidth and
increases my costs, which can make WavSource too expensive for me to
maintain.

2. If you're unable to copy sound files to your own server or a blog
server, consider linking to the WavSource page (html file) that
contains the sound you want people to hear.

3. The bandwidth thing mentioned above is very serious. Don't do it.
Abuse like that could eventually force me to either shut WavSource down
or implement theft prevention devices that would make access more
restrictive, even for legitimate visitors.

4. WavSource reserves all rights to the design and html content of this
site, unless otherwise indicated. Copying or mirroring the html content
herein is prohibited.

5. WavSource is designed to be both useful and enjoyable. It is not
designed to turn a profit or make lots of money. Ad revenue and
donations simply help offset the cost of maintaining the site. If you
find the site to be useful and enjoyable, your donation will be very
appreciated. In any case, please continue to enjoy WavSource.
